#A set of mini-games "Mind Games"

## About The Project

This is a training project in which I implemented a set of mini-games launched from the console.
Each game consists of 3 rounds. The player wins if all the questions were answered correctly. The set of mini-games includes the following games:
1) Check for parity (the player must answer, is the even number?)
2) Calculator (the player must perform arithmetic on two numbers)
3) GCD (the player must write the greatest common divisor of two numbers)
4) Arithmetic progression (the player must insert the missing number in the arithmetic progression)
5) Simple number? (the player must answer, is the number simple?)

## Getting Started
### Installation
1. Clone the repo
```sh 
git clone https://github.com/alexandertolchinsky/backend-project-lvl1.git
```
2. Install package localy
```sh
npm link
```

##How to run

mini-game "Check for parity" 
```sh 
brain-even
```
mini-game "Calculator
```sh 
brain-calc
```
mini-game "GCD"
```sh 
brain-gcd
```
mini-game "Arithmetic progression"
```sh
brain-progression
